## Python Classes/Objects

Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Object Methods

Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

## Create Object

Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

### Example

Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
<pre>
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
</pre>
## What is a Package?

A package contains all the files you need for a module.

Modules are Python code libraries you can include in your project.
